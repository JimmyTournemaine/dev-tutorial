## Setup

If you have Python3 installed set the DEVTUTO_COMPOSE environment variable like the following  `export DEVTUTO_COMPOSE="$(pwd)/bin/compose/compose.py"`.
Otherwise, you should download the bundled script for your OS in the last CI/CD build and set the `DEVTUTO_COMPOSE` variable accordingly.
